# Diabetes-Detection-System-with-Streamlit
*A beginner level end to end machine learning project using streamlit.*

In this basic end-to-end machine learning project, we will demonstrate how we will use a machine learning model in real world applications. First we need to define the objective of our project. The objective of a project helps to understand why we are doing a particular project, the problem we are trying to solve and how our end result should look like.

## Objective 
We will build a **Diabetes Detection System** web application using *Streamlit*.

## Steps
- Getting the data : We will be using *PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATABASE* dataset available on Kaggle.
- Exploratory Data Analysis : We will perform a number of **EDA** operations to understand and visualize the data
- Training the Model : Training a variety of machine learning models and comparing their metrics.
- Exporting the best Model : We will dump the best trained model to `.pkl` file and use it later for prediction
- Building an interactive web application : Keeping in mind that this is a basic and beginner level project, we will be using *Streamlit*, a python framework for creating and deploying data science and machine learning applications.

## The end user interface of our web application will look something similar as shown below.
